I'm Python learning 

This is my 5th github attempt and I was able to do it after 4th hour. I'm extremely happy haahha it's 2 am at night and I'm not sleepy because I succeeded.

I have a 1-month report because my hip is broken, so I will take this opportunity and learn the Python language at home. Maybe this curiosity, excitement and desire to learn are very good qualities that make people say they can do it.

day 2 : I came to the lists and now I'm learning on GitHub, I'll continue tomorrow.

day 4 : Today, the concepts of conditions, operators and lists are also over. The doctor gave me a report for 1 more month. It wasn't beneficial for me before, I loved working, but now it is. I work on Python at home for 7 to 8 hours and solve problems by making examples. It is productive. it's a very nice thing to learn, it gives a person self-confidence 
Today, I was able to commit to GitHub without looking anywhere.

day 8 :For the past 4 days, I finished working on the file and took a break because an idea came to my mind; the idea that came to me is this: to set up a fully automatic reels content creation automation system using "openai" in Python. It sort of worked, though I ran into some errors; I couldn't get it to do voiceovers and create visuals at the same time. But I haven't forgotten this idea; I’ll continue. In the meantime, I created something similar on the "n8n.io" site, and it's working pretty well; I’m even posting on Instagram hahahaha. Anyway, the more I learn, the deeper I want to dive into it. Whenever I get errors, I spend hours trying to fix them without realizing it, and I feel really happy when I solve the problem. Anyway, my goal this month is to master Python, and next month, I want to start learning Java.
