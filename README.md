I'm Python learning 

This is my 5th github attempt and I was able to do it after 4th hour. I'm extremely happy haahha it's 2 am at night and I'm not sleepy because I succeeded.

I have a 1-month report because my hip is broken, so I will take this opportunity and learn the Python language at home. Maybe this curiosity, excitement and desire to learn are very good qualities that make people say they can do it.

day 2 : I came to the lists and now I'm learning on GitHub, I'll continue tomorrow.

day 4 : Today, the concepts of conditions, operators and lists are also over. The doctor gave me a report for 1 more month. It wasn't beneficial for me before, I loved working, but now it is. I work on Python at home for 7 to 8 hours and solve problems by making examples. It is productive. it's a very nice thing to learn, it gives a person self-confidence 
Today, I was able to commit to GitHub without looking anywhere.
