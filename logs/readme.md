    <th>Niyet:)</th>
    <th>  I have a 1-month report because my hip is broken, so I will take this opportunity and learn the Python language at home. Maybe this curiosity, excitement and desire to learn are very good qualities that make people say they can do it.  </th>

    <td>Day 4:</td>
    <td>Today, the concepts of conditions, operators and lists are also over. The doctor gave me a report for 1 more month. It wasn't beneficial for me before, I loved working, but now it is. I work on Python at home for 7 to 8 hours and solve problems by making examples. It is productive. it's a very nice thing to learn, it gives a person self-confidence Today, I was able to commit to GitHub without looking anywhere.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Day 8:</td>
    <td>For the past 4 days, I finished working on the file and took a break because an idea came to my mind; the idea that came to me is this: to set up a fully automatic reels content creation automation system using "openai" in Python. It sort of worked, though I ran into some errors; I couldn't get it to do voiceovers and create visuals at the same time. But I haven't forgotten this idea; I’ll continue. In the meantime, I created something similar on the "n8n.io" site, and it's working pretty well; I’m even posting on Instagram hahahaha. Anyway, the more I learn, the deeper I want to dive into it. Whenever I get errors, I spend hours trying to fix them without realizing it, and I feel really happy when I solve the problem. Anyway, my goal this month is to master Python, and next month, I want to start learning Java.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>Day 10 </th>
    <td>Today, the online course I took for intermediate-level Python ended. Now I can do some things directly, but I will continue to develop and add on to it because, as Rocky said, 'your biggest opponent is yourself from yesterday.' Even if I know just one more word than yesterday, I am the one who benefits. We should always work to get better.</td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Day 17 </th>
    <td>I think I slacked off a bit this week, but I'm trying to learn both SQL and Python. I spend 6 hours a day on Python and 2 hours on SQL. Hopefully, I'll learn both languages before the end of this month.</td>
